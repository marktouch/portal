       <p>Hello I'm Marcella touch. I also go by my khmer name, Kimlorn. I've spent numerous 
        hours in developing technical skills on my own with projects in Java, and recently 
        learning web development though the first section of the learning and development phase
         of Yearup. Yearup in short is a non-profit that allows young adults to build professional
        skills to jumpstart our careers in the corporate space. I've taken it upon myself to follow
    the app development track as I feel that the coursework aligns with my ideal of becoming
a software engineer and building soft skills that put me in a position to be an effective
employee within the workspace.</p>
<p>Outside of Yearup I'm taking classes at Bellevue College to complete their bachelors program 
    in Computer Science. I've been grateful to be accepted into the program and learning Programming
    fundamentals in a more formal setting. i have about a year left into the program after completing
    all the prerequisites after compeleting the Associates in Art & science and am starting senior
    coursework this upcoming quarter. As for work experience, I've spent some time working as a market
    research interviewer at Pacific Market Research. At PMR I learned persuasive skills in order to complete
    interviews of our client's customers. Some tasks I was responsible for was using the company database to log
    the customer's answers accuratly to prepare the data for analyzation by our business analyst team.
    I was also resposible for completing at least 60 calls an hour and delivering these interviews
    efficiently in respect to the customer's time and leaving room to complete as many interviews as possible.
    I've also spent a lot of time delivering for DoorDash and Amazon in order to save for college courses.
